My journey with the French language has been a rewarding pursuit over the past few years, filled with both challenges and moments of joy.

On Duolingo, I am proud to have maintained a 597-day streak—a testament to my dedication and consistency.

I have immersed myself in the world of French podcasts, having completed the first seven episodes of the InnerFrench podcast:

### InnerFrench Podcast – First 7 Episodes

1. **#01 Apprendre le français naturellement**  
    *Summary:* This introductory episode explains the podcast's philosophy, based on Professor Stephen Krashen's language acquisition theory. It emphasizes the importance of natural listening and encourages learners not to worry too much about grammar.
2. **#02 Vivre avec des robots**  
    *Summary:* This episode discusses "emotional robots," a new type of robot that can understand human feelings. It explores the idea of these machines interacting with families and companies, raising questions about their societal impact.
3. **#03 Les pays les plus heureux du monde**  
    *Summary:* This episode delves into the concept of happiness, both from a philosophical perspective and in the context of the **World Happiness Report 2017**. It also touches on the "dictatorship of happiness."
4. **#04 La théorie du genre**  
    *Summary:* This episode examines **gender studies** and how they help us understand the differences between sexes from a social, rather than purely biological, perspective. It uses examples from books, movies, and psychological experiments.
5. **#05 Le nouveau Président français**  
    *Summary:* This episode focuses on the surprising election of **Emmanuel Macron**, France's youngest-ever president. It explores his background, how he managed to win, and his political platform.
6. **#06 Les avantages cachés de l'apprentissage d'une langue**  
    *Summary:* Beyond the obvious benefits like career advancement or travel, this episode uncovers the lesser-known advantages of learning a new language, such as cognitive benefits and a new way of thinking.
7. **#07 Les théories du complot**  
    *Summary:* This episode discusses **conspiracy theories**, explaining how they are constructed and why they pose a threat to democracy. It even gives the listener a recipe to create their own (fictional) conspiracy theory.

Recently, I embarked on the Coffee Break French podcast, beginning at Season 2, Episode 31. I enjoy the flexibility to explore lessons in any order that suits my learning needs.

Through my workplace, I am currently engaged in Level 7 of the LRDG French language training program, which continues to enrich my understanding and appreciation of the language.
