As you can see between share price purchased at and current share price, I am in *RED*

Only SilverLining is the dividends with these stocks, [BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) pays $3.99 CAD per year paid quarterly whereas [AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) pays $1.8 CAD per year paid monthly. This results into 905 X .9975 = $902.7375 CAD quarterly from BCE and 484 X .15 = $72.6 CAD monthly from AP.UN. This allows me to DCA up or down as needed.

**I do believe in the companies I have invested in and certain of recovery in the medium to long term, and if I had more money I would average down.**

>**"They say do not time the market, but markets are at an all-time high and in my mind, there will be a pullback. My end goal is to be in XEQT/VFV/VCN/VIU and not take part in individual stocks. As opportunities arise, I will pivot towards that set-up which provides the necessary diversification."
