One of my new year resolutions was to "read more" and consistently. First book I selected to read was [Money Master The Game](https://www.amazon.ca/MONEY-Master-Game-Financial-Freedom/dp/1476757860/) by Tony Robbins which I bought in 2016-17 but never finished. It is a 600 page book, am closing in on the final 100 pages. Really happy with the progress so far. 

| Time Taken To Read      | Book Title | Author | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| January - March 2024      | [Money Master The Game](https://www.amazon.ca/MONEY-Master-Game-Financial-Freedom/dp/1476757860/)| Tony Robbins 

I will be writing a review of the book in my future posts.


<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
