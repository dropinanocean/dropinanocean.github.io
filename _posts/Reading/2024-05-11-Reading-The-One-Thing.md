<p><b>My last post about the book "The One Thing" was on March 29, 2024. Today it is May 11,2024 and I finally finished reading this book. I was lazy and reverted back to the habit of using too much phone watching reddit, reels etc. causing delays.
Going forward, I do intend to work on the habit of "putting my phone downstairs before heading to bed upstairs, mobile data and wi-fi off" - read before sleep and stay in line with "1 Book a Month" goal for 2024.<b></p>

<!-- My next reading goal is to finish, [The One Thing](https://www.amazon.ca/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776) by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan -->

### Summary

One quote that sums up the book for me is:

> A life worth living might be measured in many ways, but the one way that stands above all others is living a life of no regrets.

### Key Points

- The quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question. Ask the wrong question, get the wrong answer. Ask the right question, get the right answer. Ask the most powerful question possible, and the answer can be life-altering.
- The Focusing Question can lead you to answer not only big picture questions (Where am I going? What target should I aim for?) but also small focus ones as well (What must I do right now to be on the path to getting the big picture? Where’s the bulls-eye?).
- To stay on track for the best possible day, month, year, or career, you must keep asking the Focusing Question.
- The Focusing Question collapses all possible questions into one: “What’s the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”

**Chapter 11: The Success Habit**

The Focusing Question can direct you to your ONE Thing in the different areas of your life.

You can also include a time frame—such as “right now” or “this year”—to give your answer the appropriate level of immediacy, or “in five years” or “someday” to find a big-picture answer that points you at outcomes to aim for.

Say the category first, then state the question, add a time frame, and end by adding “such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” For example: “For my job, what’s the ONE Thing I can do to ensure I hit my goals this week such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”

**Chapter 12: The Path to Great Answers**

Answers come in three categories: doable, stretch, and possibility.

Extraordinary results require a Great Answer.

A Great Answer is essentially a new answer.

The research and experience of others is the best place to start when looking for your answer.

Your big ONE Thing is your purpose and your small ONE Thing is the priority you take action on to achieve it.

**Chapter 13: Live with Purpose**

Our purpose sets our priority and our priority determines the productivity our actions produce.

Who we are and where we want to go determine what we do and what we accomplish.

Happiness happens on the way to fulfillment.

To be financially wealthy you must have a purpose for your life. In other words, without purpose, you’ll never know when you have enough money, and you can never be financially wealthy.

**Chapter 14: Live by Priority**

Purpose without priority is powerless.

The truth about success is that our ability to achieve extraordinary results in the future lies in stringing together powerful moments, one after the other.

Visualizing the process—breaking a big goal down into the steps needed to achieve it—helps engage the strategic thinking you need to plan for and achieve extraordinary results.

In one study, those who wrote down their goals were 39.5 percent more likely to accomplish them.

**Chapter 15: Live for Productivity**

Putting together a life of extraordinary results simply comes down to getting the most out of what you do, when what you do matters.

The most successful people are the most productive people.

>If disproportionate results come from one activity, then you must give that one activity disproportionate time.

To achieve extraordinary results and experience greatness, time block these three things in the following order:    

- Time block your time off
- Time block your ONE Thing
- Time block your planning time

Block time as early in your day as you possibly can.

Keller’s recommendation is to block four hours a day.

“Maker” time requires large blocks of the clock to write code, develop ideas, generate leads, recruit people, produce products, or execute on projects and plans. This time tends to be viewed in half-day increments.

“Manager time,” on the other hand, gets divided into hours. This time typically has one moving from meeting to meeting, and because those who oversee or direct tend to have power and authority, “they are in a position to make everyone resonate at their frequency.”

To experience extraordinary results, be a maker in the morning and a manager in the afternoon.

Block an hour each week to review your annual and monthly goals.

>There is magic in knocking down your most important domino day after day.

**Chapter 16: The Three Commitments**

Achieving extraordinary results through time blocking requires three commitments. 

- you must adopt the mindset of someone seeking mastery. 
- you must continually seek the very best ways of doing things. 
- you must be willing to be held accountable to doing everything you can to achieve your ONE Thing.

The path of mastering something is the combination of not only doing the best you can do, but also doing it the best it can be done.

Anders Ericsson observed that “the single most important difference between these amateurs and the three groups of elite performers is that the future elite performers seek out teachers and coaches and engage in supervised training, whereas the amateurs rarely engage in similar types of practice.”

**Chapter 17: The Four Thieves**

The Four Thieves of Productivity

- Inability to Say “No”
- Fear of Chaos
- Poor Health Habits
- Environment Doesn’t Support Your Goals

When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to.

You can’t please everyone, so don’t try.

When you strive for greatness, chaos is guaranteed to show up.

Personal energy mismanagement is a silent thief of productivity.

**The Highly Productive Person’s Daily Energy Plan**

- Meditate and pray for spiritual energy  
- Eat right, exercise, and sleep sufficiently for physical energy
- Hug, kiss, and laugh with loved ones for emotional energy
- Set goals, plan, and calendar for mental energy
- Time block your ONE Thing for business energy

For you to achieve extraordinary results, the people surrounding you and your physical surroundings must support your goals.

No one succeeds alone and no one fails alone. Pay attention to the people around you.

>At any moment in time there can be only ONE Thing, and when that ONE Thing is in line with your purpose and sits atop your priorities, it will be the most productive thing you can do to launch you toward the best you can be.

When you know what matters most, everything makes sense. When you don’t know what matters most, anything makes sense.

See you next time!!!
