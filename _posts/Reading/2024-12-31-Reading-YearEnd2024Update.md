### Year End Thoughts

I did start a couple books after these, such as "How to Win Friends and Influence People," but did not complete all the way through.

For 2025, I am resetting this goal with another promise in mind: this year I will do one book a month, for sure. Looking forward to a more promising update at the end of 2025.
