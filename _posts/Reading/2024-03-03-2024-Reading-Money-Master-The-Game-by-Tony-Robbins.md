**One of my new year resolutions was to "read more" and consistently. First book I selected to read was [Money Master The Game](https://www.amazon.ca/MONEY-Master-Game-Financial-Freedom/dp/1476757860/) by Tony Robbins which I bought in 2016-17 but never finished. It is a 600 page book, am closing in on the final 100 pages. Really happy with the progress so far.**

| Time Taken To Read      | Book Title | Author | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| January - March 2024      | [Money Master The Game](https://www.amazon.ca/MONEY-Master-Game-Financial-Freedom/dp/1476757860/)| Tony Robbins 

**[Money Master The Game](https://www.amazon.ca/MONEY-Master-Game-Financial-Freedom/dp/1476757860/) Key Takeaways:**

1. Put atleast 10% of the your earnings aside for investment. Power of compounding over time, will baloon your savings. Make it automatic as much as possible.
2. Asset Allocation:
    1. By Class (Cash, GICs, Bonds, Pension, Real Estate, Stocks)
    2. By Geography (Domestic, United States, International and Emerging Markets)
    3. By Time (Expected number of months, years, decades to achieve the financial goal) XEQT at 25, XGRO at 45, XBAL at 55 etc.
3. Diversification using low cost ETFs such as VCN, VFC, VIU etc., own the market whole market. 
4. Quote by Sir John Templeton:
>**"Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell—Sir John Templeton"**
5. Buy when markets are down
6. Rebalance by selling your runners and buying laggards to be inline with your asset allocation, atleast once a year.
7. You don’t want to hesitate to get in the market trying to have perfect timing; instead, use dollar-cost averaging and know that volatility can be your friend, providing opportunities to buy investments cheaply when the market is down. This technique will increase your portfolio’s value when the markets come back up.
8. Dream Levels: 
    1.  Financial Security
      Mortgage, utilities, insurance, food, transportation, all covered for the rest of your life.Calculate the cost of those things per month, multiply it by 12 to get your annual “Secure” income. That’s your “financial security” income, and the first dream is to save enough money to cover that.
    2. Financial Independence
      What’s the cost of your complete lifestyle right now? That’s how much you need to be bringing in to be completely financially independent.To get an idea of how much an amount of income needs to be saved for, multiple it by 20. So if you spend $100,000 a year, you need to save 2,000,000.
    3. Financial Freedom
    The cost of the lifestyle you want and deserve, above and beyond what you’re at right now. Pick three things to start.Figure out whatever else you want and the annual cost of it, and add that amount to your current annual total.
    4. Absolute Financial Freedom
      Anything you want any time you want it, never worry about money again“You don’t have to own the jet to have the lifestyle. You don’t have to own the sports team to sit in the sky box. And you don’t have to pay for the whole team to be an owner— you can be a partial owner and get all the privileges.”Write down everything you would want on this list, and figure out the cost of it.
9. Have a Dream Bucket that gives you emotional juice and excitement so you can experience the benefits of your investing prowess in the short term and midterm instead of just someday far in the future.





<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
