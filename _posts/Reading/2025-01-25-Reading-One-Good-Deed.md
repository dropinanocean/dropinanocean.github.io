### Part 1: A Fresh Start
Aloysius Archer, a World War II veteran, is released from Carderock Prison after serving time for a crime he didn't commit. He arrives in Poca City with little more than the clothes on his back and a list of parole conditions: report regularly to his parole officer, Ernestine Crabtree; avoid bars and alcohol; find employment; and steer clear of "loose women." Despite these restrictions, Archer seeks a fresh start in the small town.

### Part 2: The Debt Collector
On his first night in town, Archer visits The Cat’s Meow, a local bar, where he meets Hank Pittleman, a wealthy businessman. Pittleman hires Archer to collect a $5,000 debt owed by Lucas Tuttle, or to take possession of Tuttle’s 1947 Cadillac Series 62 as collateral. Archer accepts the job, unaware of the complex web of relationships and secrets he is about to entangle himself in.

### Part 3: Unraveling Secrets
Archer discovers that Lucas Tuttle's daughter, Jackie, is Hank Pittleman's mistress. Tuttle refuses to repay the debt until Jackie returns home. As Archer navigates this delicate situation, he uncovers deeper layers of deceit and manipulation within the town's elite.

### Part 4: A Murder in the Midst
A murder occurs in the same hotel where Archer is staying, and he becomes the prime suspect. Detective Irving Shaw, who served with Archer during the war, begins to investigate. Archer must use his wits and skills to clear his name and uncover the true culprit.

### Part 5: The Truth Revealed
As the investigation unfolds, Archer discovers the intricate connections between the townspeople and the secrets they harbor. The truth behind the murder is more complex than he initially thought, leading to a surprising and satisfying conclusion.

Aloysius Archer, the protagonist, is wrongfully accused of the crime and must investigate to clear his name.

After a thorough investigation, Archer uncovers that the true murderer is Lucas Tuttle, the man who owed Pittleman money. Tuttle killed Pittleman in a fit of rage over the debt and the complicated relationships involving Pittleman's mistress, Jackie. Tuttle's actions were driven by a combination of financial desperation and personal vendettas.

Archer's persistence and investigative skills lead to the revelation of the true culprit, clearing his name and restoring justice to the community.

Marjorie Pittleman is the wife of Hank Pittleman, a wealthy and influential businessman in the small town of Poca City. While she doesn't play a central role in the novel's events, her character adds depth to the story's exploration of relationships and motivations.

Marjorie is aware of her husband's extramarital affair with Jackie Tuttle, the daughter of Lucas Tuttle, who owes Hank a significant sum of money. Despite this knowledge, she remains in her marriage, possibly due to financial dependence or social expectations. Her character reflects the complexities and compromises individuals often make in personal relationships, especially within the constraints of societal norms and economic pressures.

While Marjorie doesn't directly influence the central plot of the murder mystery, her presence underscores the themes of betrayal, loyalty, and the hidden lives of seemingly respectable individuals in the novel.

### My Thoughts
One Good Deed is a gripping historical crime novel that masterfully blends suspense, moral dilemmas, and post-war Americana. Aloysius Archer is a compelling protagonist—flawed yet principled, determined to do what’s right even when the odds are against him. I really appreciated how Baldacci explored themes of justice, integrity, and redemption through Archer’s eyes.

The story keeps you engaged with its layered mysteries, complex relationships, and unexpected twists. I found the depiction of the townspeople—each with secrets, motives, and hidden desires—both realistic and fascinating. Characters like Lucas Tuttle and Marjorie Pittleman add depth, showing how greed, betrayal, and personal struggles can drive people to extreme actions.

What I loved most is the message that even a single person’s moral courage—Archer’s “one good deed”—can ripple out to create significant change, restoring justice and revealing truth. It’s not just a mystery; it’s a story about character, choices, and the consequences of our actions.

Overall, the novel is thrilling, thought-provoking, and emotionally satisfying—a perfect combination for anyone who enjoys historical crime fiction with a moral center.
