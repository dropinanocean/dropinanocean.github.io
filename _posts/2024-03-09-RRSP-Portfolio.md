[BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE)
[AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN)

As you all know, I just finished reading [Money Master The Game](https://www.amazon.ca/MONEY-Master-Game-Financial-Freedom/dp/1476757860/) which means I have learnt by now to save and diversify the investments. That being said, at the moment my RRSP is not in the best shape by any means. It is red and contains two dividend paying Canadian Companies. 

| Stock | Number of Shares | Book Value | Market Value | Portfolio Percentage |
| ----- |----- |----- |----- |----- |
| [Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) | 905 | 49,083.12 | 44,625.55 | 84.01% |
| [Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) | 484 | 10,148.08| 8,499.04 | 15.99% |

As you can see between book value and market value, I am almost 7k in *RED*

Only SilverLining is the dividends with these stocks, [BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) pays $3.99 CAD per year paid quarterly whereas [AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) pays $1.8 CAD per year paid monthly. This results into 905 X .9975 = $902.7375 CAD quarterly from BCE and 484 X .15 = $72.6 CAD monthly from AP.UN. This allows me to DCA up or down as needed.

**I do believe in the companies I have invested in and certain of recovery in the medium to long term, and if I had more money I would average down.**

>**"They say do not time the market, but markets are at an all-time high and in my mind, there will be a pullback. My end goal is to be in XEQT/VFV/VCN/VIU and not take part in individual stocks. As opportunities arise, I will pivot towards that set-up which provides the necessary diversification."

[BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) next dividend of $.9975 CAD has ex-dividend of Mar 15 2024 and payout date of April 15 2024. I will be getting $902.7375 CAD for my [BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) holdings. 

[AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) next dividend of $.15 had ex-dividend of Feb 28 2024 and payout date of Mar 15 2024, I will be getting $72.6 CAD for my [AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) holdings.
