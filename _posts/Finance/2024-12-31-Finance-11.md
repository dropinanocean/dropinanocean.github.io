<p>Wealhsimple offered free iphone 16 128GB for transfers > CAD 100k and transfer fee reimbursements. I said YES!</p>

This is what I  liked about Wealthsimple, alongside [iPhone Promo](https://forums.redflagdeals.com/wealthsimple-2024-free-iphone-macbook-promotion-net-new-deposits-2722196/) and transfer fee reimbursements:
- Free CAD stock buy and sells, even NBDB had it. 
- 30 minute funding (upto a limit) for my RRSP and TFSA, via Interac. This comes super clutch if you would like to purchase a stock on a given day because of the price fluctuations. 
- Automations such as scheduled deposits, recurring investments, automated share repurchases from the dividends etc. 
- Household pooling for Premium and Generation Benefits. 
- For premium, as of December 31 2024 2.75% interest rate on cash accounts. Additional, .5% with direct deposits of $2000 in a month. So a total of 3.25% with premium account (>100k) and a direct deposit.
- There is credit card and a debit card, which I have not used much.
- With premium, free 8 tax returns with Wealthsimple Tax. 
- When reached >200k, [more benefits](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/benefits)

So far it is going great. Will update if anything changes.
