<p>My plan is to XEQT one portfolio at a time.</p>

[XEQTing](https://dropinanocean.github.io/finance/2024/08/11/Finance-6.html) 

At the moment, my kid's RESP is fully XEQTed!! 
- 2025 will bring a new addition, and that would be my wife's TFSA. 
- I will open a TFSA with Questrade, with a recurring $125 every two weeks contribution. 
- In parallel, I will connect Questrade with [Passiv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXC472vBdb8&ab_channel=Questrade) for One Click Buys as soon as contributions land in Questrade. 
- I will do market buys from passiv, to make it simpler for both kid's RESP and wife's TFSA. I would like to follow the XEQT strategy rather than getting the best price on the cent basis, on each buy. 
- Another goal is not to add anything to my TFSA, as it already is overweight in Telecom sector. My own TFSA is a money pit and need to be fixed, and diversified. My TFSA, you will not be getting any more money in 2025. Just the dividends from existing holdings. 

<b> Rest of the Savings Money will be used to pay down the mortgage as much as possible.</b>

- GOAL is to pay down the allocated amount of 20% prepayment privilege alongside regular payments.
