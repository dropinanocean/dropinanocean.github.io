<p>In my search for a free yet powerful investment tracking tool, I wanted something that could consolidate all of my accounts in one place.A solution that centralizes reporting and provides deep insights into every detail of the entire family’s portfolio.</p>

My search finally stopped at [<b> Portfolio Performance </b>](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/)

- PP is [open-source](https://github.com/portfolio-performance)
- I used two types of accounts in there:
  - Security Accounts (For stocks)
  - Deposit Accounts (For left over cash)
  
  *For e.g. a RRSP account at Questrade, I used a QTRRSPSecurityAccount and a QTRRSPDepositAccount. In QTRRSPSecurityAccount I used inbound type transactions, to bring over my existing stock holdings at an avg price as shown by Questrade.  You can also import full transaction data via csv or pdf files.  In QTRRSPDepositAccount, I added the cash that is not invested in my RRSP account at Questrade.*
- After the initial inbound type transactions, rest of the transactions in Security Accounts would be buy,sell,dividends etc. as changes happen to the investment accounts. 
- After all the imports I ended up with six Security and six corresponding Deposit accounts for the whole family.
- [<b> Portfolio Performance </b>](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/)allows:
  - Portfolio Performance Tracking  
  - Transaction History  
  - Historical and Real-Time Price Data (from Yahoo Finance)  
  - Portfolio Visualization  
  - Asset Allocation and Rebalancing  
  - Windows/Linux/Mac based powerful applications for the management/monitoring
  - Android and iOS based apps for monitoring only

Going forward, I will use brokerages solely for executing trades, immediately recording each transaction in Portfolio Performance, and rely on it as a single, comprehensive view of the entire household’s investments.
