<!---<p><b>Bell Shares slump almost 5% on ex-dividend day.On this day of March 14 2024, downward momentum towards Bell Canada Enterprises shares continued.</b></p>-->

On August 12 2024, [Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) closed at the price $47.84 up five dollars from it is low of $42.58 on the first week of July 2024. Alongside Bank of Canada rate cuts of .25% on two occasions, a not so bad earnings and fear of recession gave a bump to safe utility type telecom stocks.

[Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) on the side is still struggling and closed down 1.607% at $16.53. Office Real Estate outlook has not recovered, hopefully more rate cuts will give it some legs to run.  

Also, I have started a long term position in the All Equity Asset Allocation ETF [XEQT](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XEQT). You can read more at this [link](https://dropinanocean.github.io/finance/2024/08/11/Finance.html).
