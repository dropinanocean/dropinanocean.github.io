In the month of November 2025, I received $155.14 from the VAB Bond ETF and $21.16 from the ZAG Bond ETF.

In the month of December 2025, I received $138.24 from the VAB Bond ETF and $21.68 from the ZAG Bond ETF. 

I do not have a cash position. Any cash money is a holding in the bond etfs VAB or ZAG yielding about 3% yearly that could be liquidated for any opportunities.

My Canadian Telco Holdings of BCE, T and RCI.B had their ex-dividend days this month december 2025 and will pay in the month of January 2026. 

As of today Dec 19 2026, my portfolio as per Portfolio performance sits at $172,096. This may have some additional contributions, dividends or just growth or losses. My short term goal is to grow it to $200,000. 

This year have been another painful year for telecom stocks. 

YTD BCE is down -5.37% not counting dividends.
YTD T is down -10.62% not counting dividends.
YTD RCI.B is up 14.30% not counting dividends. 
Overall I am green on RCI.B but deep red on T and BCE. 

Losses in the first two, and BCE being my biggest position almost 1.5x of both RCI.B and T combined, definitely made matters worse.

I will be selling RCI.B in 2026 after they decide the direction of their sports assets, I believe it will provide a good bump to the share price. If it can hit its all time high of $74, that would be fucking ideal. I am out then for sure. 
BCE and T seems like are going to be my buddies for next few years. I do not intend to sell atleast until I break even on them on the share price. Dividends would atleast be the reward for holding. I aint no loser to sell at a loss, I will ride these bitches down to zero if I had to. 

**Furthermore, I have changed my portfolio strategy going into 2026. 
Considering almost all the stock markets across the globe trading at all time highs, I will be buying solely VBAL from this point forward, which is 60% diversified stocks and 40% bonds. VBAL will allow me to have a greater confidence in my portfolio that it can handle any stocks market downward risks a little better. Also, auto rebalancing among bonds and stocks if there are stock market down years will allow me to capture the upside. Also, I wont do anything stupid if market crashes cause I will know that bonds will auto rebalance and provide me some upside at the down time. In the future, if stock markets will show major weaknesses, I intend to bump the equity portion by buying VGRO(80-20) or VEQT(100% Equity) funds**

[VBAL](https://www.vanguard.ca/en/product/etf/asset-allocation/9578/vanguard-balanced-etf-portfolio):
40% Bonds
60% Stocks
 - USA 27%
 - Canada 18%
 - International Developed ex US and Canada 10.5%
 - International Emerging Markers 4.5%

In the light of change in the approach, I added VBAL as a new holding to the portfolio. It is currently sitting at .65% of my portfolio. I intend to buy more each month with dividends from VAB and ZAG. And also quarterly with the dividends coming from my telco holdings. I am hoping in the next update I have a percentage in VBAL greater than .65% of my portfolio. 

Long term goal would be to translate everything I own to VBAL,VGRO or VEQT 
- maybe maybe maybe a little bit of Gold, Silver or Crypto. 
- I also may add some subset of markets such as NASDAQ(QQC), TSX(VCN) etc. if there are any crashes in these.
