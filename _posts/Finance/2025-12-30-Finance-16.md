## Dividend Reinvestment & Cash Handling Policy

All **dividends and distributions** received from any current investments will be **reinvested into VBAL**.

### Platform-Specific Execution

- **Wealthsimple accounts**
  - Use **fractional shares**
  - Aim for **zero residual cash**
  - Dividends and contributions are fully deployed automatically

- **Questrade accounts**
  - Fractional shares may not always be available
  - Some **residual cash** is expected to remain
  - Residual cash will be invested opportunistically when practical

This approach ensures maximum capital deployment while accommodating platform-specific limitations.

## Overall Summary

- **RESP Personal Contributions**: $5,000  
- **CESG Grants**: $1,000  
- **My TFSA Contributions**: $7,000  
- **Spouse’s TFSA Contributions**: $7,000  

**Total Family Investing (2026): $20,000**

By consolidating investments into **VBAL**, reinvesting all dividends, and automating contributions wherever possible, this plan prioritizes consistency, simplicity, and long-term discipline.
