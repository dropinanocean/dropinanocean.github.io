<p><b> As I hinted in my previous posts, my long term vision is to have everything invested in global diversified index exchange trade funds (ETFs). XEQT will do the trick. </b></p>

**Question is why [XEQT]((https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XEQT)) and why now ?**

XEQT is a combination of 4 ETFs as follows:  

1. 45% iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market ETF (ITOT)  
2. 25% iShares Core MSCI EAFE IMI Index ETF (XEF)  
3. 25% iShares Core S&P/TSX Capped Composit Idx ETF (XIC)  
4. 5%  iShares Core MSCI Emerging Mkts IMI Idx ETF (XEC)

Above allocation diversifies across US, Canada, International and Emerging Markets(India, China, Brazil etc.)

XEQT has a [Management Expense Ratio](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/309480/ishares-core-equity-etf-portfolio) of .20% which is not a lot considering the diversification, and there is no separate MER for underlying funds.

Since I am looking at a long term horizon, more than 20 years, I have selected 100 percent equity fund. As I will get closer to the retirement and I will reallocate the money to more conservative all in one funds for capital preservation such as:  

[iShares Core Balanced ETF Portfolio XBAL](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XBAL)  
[iShares Core Conservative Balanced ETF Portfolio XCNS](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XCNS)  
[iShares Core Growth ETF Portfolio XGRO](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XGRO)  
[iShares Core Income Balanced ETF Portfolio XINC](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XINC)

**Long term, Index investing has better returns and lesser downside compared to stock picking. and LESS STRESS!!**

**XEQT is invested in thousands of stocks:**

*So far I have fully moved my kid's RESP to XEQT with an entry price of $30.50 per share of XEQT. I am a bit concerned since XEQT is very close to its all time high of $31.95, however instead of waiting I have decided to plunge one portfolio at a time.* 

**For TFSA and RRSP, I will add XEQT as opportunities arise and fully pivoting towards 100% XEQT across all portfolios in the family eventually. I have some dividend individual stocks (AP.UN, BCE.TO, T.TO, QBR.TO) which will be sold during the high tides, if they ever come but I do have faith.**
