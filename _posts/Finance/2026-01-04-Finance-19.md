An event is a kind of note that can be attached to a **specific security** on a **particular date** 📝.

They are **automatically inserted** to mark occurrences of **stock splits** or **dividend announcements**, but can also be added **manually** to record **important stock news**.

**Manual events** are the simplest kind of event — they are basically **notes attached to a security**.  

They do **not change money, shares, performance, or taxes at all**.

Think of them as a **sticky note for future you** 📝
