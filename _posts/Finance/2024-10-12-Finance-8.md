<!---<p><b>Bell Shares slump almost 5% on ex-dividend day.On this day of March 14 2024, downward momentum towards Bell Canada Enterprises shares continued.</b></p>-->

On Oct 12 2024, [Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) closed at the price $45.45 down from the August 12 2024 price of $47.58. In the last two months, BoC canada announced another [.25% rate cut](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2024/09/fad-press-release-2024-09-04/), which is a good thing for BCE. Furthermore, on September 18 2024 BCE sold 37.5% stake it owned since 2012 in MLSE to Rogers [RCI](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/RCI.B) for C$4.7 Billion. This additional money will appease any dividend cut speculation to rest. BCE pays C$3.99 Billion dividend a year on a $6B operating cash flow and $2.5 Billion of free cash flow, putting almost a $1.5Billion shortfall where FCF does not cover the dividend. BCE is also selling Northwest Tel to a group of indigenous communities for C$1B dollars. Ideally, I want BCE to be more efficient with Operating Cash Flow(reduce CapEx,OpEx etc.), while also trying to increase the revenue in a meaningful rather than trying to sustain the dividend for as long as they can. Bell saw the high of $49 on the [MLSE sale](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bell-rogers-mlse-1.7326526) news. They also payed a dividend of almost a $1 in the last the two months, dragging the share price by the same amount.


[Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) is on a good run and closed at $19.47. Office Real Estate outlook with RTO alongside rest of the market bull run and rate cuts, giving it a really nice momentum. I will be holding this stock forever, and enjoy that monthly dividend with the annual 8% yield.

I have been consistently adding to [XEQT](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XEQT) which is all of my kid's RESP portfolio. [XEQT](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XEQT) is on a tear this year, and closed at $33.14. 

Deep down in my heart, I still believe telecom companies BCE, RCI and T has good assets. Also, they are part of one the laggard sectors, Telecom. Reasons include Quebecor's acquisition of FreedomMobile intensifying the competition for wireless plan prices, regulatory hurdles such as CRTC's ruling that BCE must share their fibre with other smaller players as resellers at the wholesale price of $68 a connection up to 1.5Gbps. In my mind, US and Canadian stock markets are at an all time high and in general utility type telecom players struggle as money is to be made in the rest of market, in case recessionary fears leading to rate cuts, these stocks will fly of the shelves. I am continuing to build larger and larger positions in Rogers and Telus alongside a massive position in BCE. I will be trimming a bit of BCE in the $50+ range to reduce the risk. 

Furthermore, I believe Rogers has a better wireless network overall and Shaw acquisition makes it a true Canada wide player. Cable internet is not the best compared to Fibre which Bell and Telus has but it still is pretty good. I am writing this article using a Shaw 250Mbps connection for $50 per month for 2 years. With [MLSE sale](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bell-rogers-mlse-1.7326526), Rogers will be the sole owner for all the Toronto teams leafs, raptors and jays. They still have to buy the 25% owned by Kilmer Group which will be available in 2025-2026. They also owns the Jays Home Stadium Rogers Place. They will have an opportunity to IPO this sports entity in the next few years. I will be adding a lot of [RCI](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/RCI.B) in my portfolio under $55. I have a good position already in it at an average of $53 but would not hesitate to add more as dividends roll, and new money is added.

Caveat with RCI is, they have not raised their divided since 2019 and pays about 3.8% a year, which is not bad and they have no cash flow concerns for dividend payout. 

Apart from kids RESP, I have not added [XEQT](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/XEQT) to any of my other portfolios as stock market has been a straight line up. I missed the opportunity, but hopefully there will be chances under $30 in the future.
