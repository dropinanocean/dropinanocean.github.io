<p>BCE is in shambles closing at $33.32 compared to $45.45 price of Oct 12 2024, RCI.B closed at $44.19 and T closed at $19.49</p>

So much has happened since my last update on October 12,2024. As of December 31,2024 which is today here is a list of updates in my portfolio:

- On Nov 4,2024 BCE announced that they are [acquiring US based Ziply Fiber.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bce-ziply-mlse-1.7374405)
- [As per my update on Oct 12,2024](https://dropinanocean.github.io/finance/2024/10/12/Finance-8.html) - I was sort of glad that BCE sold MLSE for $4.7 Billion which will alleviate debt and dividend cut concerns, making business stable in the light of competitive landscape with Rogers-Shaw merging, Quebecor becoming a 4th national wireless provider with the acquisition of freedom mobile from Shaw. (It was a condition for freedom to be sold for Rogers and Shaw to merge) But Bell went ahead and used the cash to buy a US company for almost $5Billion CAD and additional $2Billion in debt. 
- This sent BCE into a spin, market did not like the allocation of money and stock was down more than 10% in a day. Fuck me!! 
- As December 2024 started, Telecom stocks were the only laggards in the portfolios since TSX and US markets were at an all time high. Tax loss harvesting sell-off started in the sector and BCE as of today hit a low of $33.32. Absolutely nuked I feel!!
- Sold [Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) at $18.51 to make room to buy depressed telecom stocks including BCE.
- In the light of [iPhone promo for wealthsimple](https://forums.redflagdeals.com/wealthsimple-2024-free-iphone-macbook-promotion-net-new-deposits-2722196/), I transferred my TFSA and RRSP from NBDB to Wealthsimple. I will be getting a iPhone 16 128GB sometime in the first quarter of 2025.
- [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca) in itself even without the promotion is an amazing platform. I would likely write another post of its own in the coming months. 
- In the meltdown December 2024 month for telecom stocks, in the light of tax loss harvesting. I added $12000 more to my TFSA, so buy some more of these beaten down stocks. Probably a shit decision!!!

This is what I bought:
2, T at $20.90
21, RCI.B at $47.26
27, BCE at $36.30
4, RCI.B at $46.50
26, RCI.B at $46.49
87, BCE at $34.45
148, T at $20.29
33, RCI.B at $44.55
77, T at $19.85

I am about ~25 percent down across my RRSP and TFSA. Shit year overall!! 

- 100% concentrated in the telecom industry. 
- Sitting at:

| **Stock** | **Shares** | **Share Price on December 31 2024** |
