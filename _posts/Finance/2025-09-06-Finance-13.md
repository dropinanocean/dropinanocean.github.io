- I previously advocated for a 100% XEQT portfolio, but now I prefer an 80/20 split between equities and bonds.
- Allocating 20% to bonds provides a cushion for rebalancing during market corrections and helps reduce overall volatility.
- My current portfolio consists of **81.37% stocks** and **18.63% bonds/cash**.
- For simplicity, Initial focus is on building a portfolio with only XEQT and VAB, aiming for an 80/20 ratio.
- Reducing my telecom stock holdings will be a challenge, depending on how long the sector takes to recover.

Below is the current state of my portfolio:

| Qty   | Security                           | Price  | Current Value  |
|-------|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------|
| 2,098 | BCE INC.                           | 34.23  | 71,814.54      |
| 714   | ISHARES CORE EQUITY ETF            | 37.83  | 27,010.62      |
| 470   | ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS INC., CL.   | 49.70  | 23,359.00      |
| 1,007 | TELUS CORPORATION                  | 22.97  | 23,130.79      |
| 1,416 | VANGUARD CDN AGGREGATE BOND IND   | 23.05  | 32,638.80      |
| **Total** |                               |        | **177,953.75** |

Here are the changes made in August and September:

- Increased positions in ISHARES CORE EQUITY ETF and VANGUARD CDN AGGREGATE BOND IND.
- Made several deposits and received interest and dividends.
- These actions reflect ongoing rebalancing towards 80/20 XEQT/VAB.

Stay tuned for more updates!!!
