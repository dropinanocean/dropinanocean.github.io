- I previously advocated for a 100% XEQT portfolio, but now I prefer an 80/20 split between equities and bonds.
- Allocating 20% to bonds provides a cushion for rebalancing during market corrections and helps reduce overall volatility.
- My current portfolio consists of **81.37% stocks** and **18.63% bonds/cash**.
- I am pondering higher US allocations (ZSP or XTOT) and at times buying more of weaker market ETFs rather than just XEQT. For e.g. if the US market is at an all-time high and the CA market is down 20%, I would buy more VCN.
- For simplicity, Initial focus is on building a portfolio with only XEQT and VAB, aiming for an 80/20 ratio.
- Reducing my telecom stock holdings will be a challenge, depending on how long the sector takes to recover.

Below is the current state of my portfolio:
