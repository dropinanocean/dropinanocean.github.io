I used to be a strong advocate for a 100% XEQT portfolio, but I've realized that I am more comfortable with an 80/20 equity-bond split. Having 20% in bonds provides a cushion to rebalance during major stock market corrections and helps reduce volatility.

Currently, my portfolio consists of 81.37% stocks and 18.63% bonds/cash.

My main holdings are XEQT and VAB, though I am intrigued by higher US allocations such as ZSP or XTOT. I am also considering buying more of weaker market ETFs rather than just XEQT, which always has a mix in the form of 25-45-25-5 CA-US-International-Emerging. For example, if the Canadian market is at an all-time high and the US market is down 20%, I would buy more of ZSP or XTOT. Conversely, if the Canadian market is struggling, buy more ZCN/VCN to increase TSX exposure.
 
For now, my focus is on building a true portfolio with only XEQT and VAB, aiming for an 80/20 ratio. Getting rid of my telecom stocks would be challenge, depending on how long the recovery takes if ever. 

Below is the current state of my portfolio:
