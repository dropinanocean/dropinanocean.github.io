<p><b>Bell Shares recovered a bit closing at $46.39. Allied Properties is still lagging closing at $16.93 with a dividend of 10.632% or CAD 15 cents a month. Started a position in Telus T.TO at CAD $22.05 </b></p>

Bought more [Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) in April 2024 as underlying businesses wireline, wireless and media are still solid. Revenue has not declined based on the earnings released on May 2, 2024. In my thesis, assets are solid and with inflation it is more and more costly to build the telecom infrastructure. Headwinds related to Decrease in Average Revenue Per User(ARPU), Cashflow not covering the Dividend and Higher Interest Rates will subside over time. 

Bought more [Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) and I will be holding this stock until better days for urban office real estate or a decrease in Interest Rates which should give a nice bounce to the share price. For someone buying at the current price, stock is yielding over 10% if you have risk tolerance and conviction of a turn around.

Started a position in [TELUS Corporation](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/T) at CAD $22.05. Thesis and sector is similar to [Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE). BCE operates in Atlantic Canada, Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba while Telus operates in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Telus does not do media, instead has divisions for Telus Health, Telus Agriculture and Telus Call Centres operating under [Telus International](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/TIXT). Whole telecommunication sector is under the knife, and I wanted to add another player to the portfolio with a depressed share price.

>"They say do not time the market, but markets are at an all-time high and in my mind, there will be a pullback. My end goal is to be in XEQT/VFV/VCN/VIU and not take part in individual stocks. As opportunities arise, I will pivot towards that set-up which provides the necessary diversification."
