<p><b>Bell Shares slump even further hitting lows of $45.61. On this day of March 29 2024, downward momentum towards Bell Canada Enterprises shares continued.</b></p>

[Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) has been testing my faith lately in terms of where stock price is and what I believe company is worth. 

I still think underlying businesses wireline, wireless and media are not in trouble as share price is indicating. ARPU for wireless will find its floor, CRTC government regulations around fibre sharing results will come out as either not allow sharing except for rural areas or set decent floor rates and bell will collect that wholesale revenue.
Media has already shown its decline over the last decade and not have as much impact on the business. 
>**Furthermore, 2024 and 2025 will be time of leaner cows, and efficiencies reducing capex and opex will come from all directions.  
**Based on the above conviction, I will be buying with both hands till the time [BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) is below $50. Recently, I did buys on $46.20 and $46.25 share price.

There was no change in my position for [Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) and I will be holding this stock until better days for urban office real estate. At my cost price, I have yield of 8.5%. For someone buying at the current price, stock is yielding over 10% if you have risk tolerance and conviction of a turn around. 


| Stock | Average SP |  Current SP | Account
| ----- |----- |----- |----- |----- |
| [Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) | $54.226 | $46.03 | RRSP
| [Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) | $48.422 | 46.03 | TFSA
| [Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) | $20.967 | $17.67 | RRSP 


| Stock Dividend Info | Frequency |  Next Payout | Amount
| ----- |----- |----- |----- |----- |
[Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) | Quarterly | April 15 2024 | $.9975
[Allied Properties AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) | Monthly | April 15 2024 | $.15



As you can see between share price Average SP and Current SP, I am in **RED** minus the dividends which I am reinvesting as they come.

Only SilverLining is the dividends with these stocks, [BCE](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/BCE) pays $3.99 CAD per year paid quarterly whereas [AP.UN](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/AP.UN) pays $1.8 CAD per year paid monthly. This allows me to DCA up or down as needed. 
>** Dividends always have the intrinsic risk of being cut or trimmed.

**I do believe in the companies I have invested in and expecting a recovery in the medium to long term, and if I had more money I would average down.**

>**"They say do not time the market, but markets are at an all-time high and in my mind, there will be a pullback. My end goal is to be in XEQT/VFV/VCN/VIU and not take part in individual stocks. As opportunities arise, I will pivot towards that set-up which provides the necessary diversification."
